A place to track your strength training plans

## App overview

I want this app to follow the best practices and create it with following principles in mind:

- Test driven development
- Responsive and mobile first

Strength-Hub as an MVP will feature:

- [ ]  Input where the user provides their 1 Rep Max for Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, and Overhead Press
- [ ]  Based on 1 Rep max inputs app should calculate your proposed weight progress for next weeks
- [ ]  Checkboxes next to each set to confirm that user succeeded at lifting given weight
- [ ]  Checkbox to confirm that the whole workout was successful
- [ ]  Those should be displayed in separate cards
- [ ]  User should be able to register, login and save their progress

### Further thoughts

- [ ] User should be able to customize the plan
- [ ] Comparisons how user stacks against other users
- [ ] Visual representation of progress
